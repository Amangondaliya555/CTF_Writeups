#  caesar cipher 2

Points:250

## Question:

```Can you help us decrypt this message? We believe it is a form of a caesar cipher. You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar-cipher-2_0_372a62ea0204b948793a2b1b3aeacaaa on the shell server. 
```


## Hint:

```
1. You'll have figure out the correct alphabet that was used to encrypt the ciphertext from the ascii character set
2. ASCII Table. Link: https://www.asciitable.com/
```


# Solution:

  1.Here, we have given a file including a sentence which is mixture of alphabates, numbers and symbols.
  
  2.Hint says, it is encrypted into a form of a caesar cipher. Also the file given does not contain only alphabates so we can not 
  use caesar cipher.
  
  3.But we can use its form ROT which will simpy rotate the ciphertext according to ascii characters and give us a 
  plain text. we can use this online tool: https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher
