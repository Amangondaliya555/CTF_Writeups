# caesar cipher 1

Points:150

## Question:

```
This is one of the older ciphers in the books, can you decrypt the message? You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar-cipher-1_0_931ac10f43e4d2ee03d76f6914a07507 on the shell server. 
```


## Hint:

```caesar cipher tutorial. Link: https://learncryptography.com/classical-encryption/caesar-cipher
```


# Solution:

  1.Obviously you need to learn about caesar cipher here.You can refer to the link given in the hint.
  
  2.Please dont try it yourself. Be lazy and use my tool: https://github.com/Amangondaliya555/PyCaesar
  
  3.We have one file containing a encrypted flag.Use my tool or any other online tools and decrypt it. And for the love of god,      
  do not copy the entire flag while decrypting! pioCTF is a format of the contest. Do not decrypt it too!!! 
  
  4.It is also little bit tedious to solve it without knowing the key. You can use some online tools which will use dictionary and
    provide you the best result. Spoiler here.... The key K=15.
