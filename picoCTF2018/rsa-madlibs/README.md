## Question:

```
We ran into some weird puzzles we think may mean something, can you help me solve one? Connect with nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 50652
```


## Hint:

```
RSA info. Link : https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm
```


# Solution:

  1.Here, i cant help you too much, but the link given in the hint can. 
  
  2.Go through that link and learn how RSA works.
  
  3.After knowing basics of RSA, you can answer all the questions which will appear when you will connect to the given port through 
  the terminal.
  
  4.For few questions you may need this tool to find some values : https://github.com/mzfr/ctf-writeups/blob/master/picoCTF-
  2018/Cryptography/rsa-madlibs/calculate-d.py
  
  5.Also you will have to use pow function of python to calculate few values.
  
  NOTE : This is temporary solution. To make things easier, i am making one rsa tool to make your job even easier.
