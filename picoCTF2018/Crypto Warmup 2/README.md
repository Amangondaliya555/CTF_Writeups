# Crypto Warmup 2

Points:75

## Question:

```
 Cryptography doesn't have to be complicated, have you ever heard of something called rot13? cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!}
```


## Hint:

```
This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!
```


# Solution:

  1. rot13 is a special case of caesar cipher for rotation = 13.
  2. You can do it by simple rotation of cipher text upto 13 times or you can refer to any online tool for rot13.
  3. Or you can refer my python tool : https://github.com/Amangondaliya555/PyCaesar.git 
  4. My tool has some limitations like it will give nonsense in place of symbols. So you can fix it yourself.
